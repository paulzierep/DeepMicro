# Idea

Try to export deepmicro models as keras h5 or galaxy-ML dump

## AE test

load_model.py shows how the keras model can be reloaded for prediction

## Install

```
mamba create -n deepML python=3.10 (probably need to check if deepmicro can run on 3.9)
conda activate deepML
mamba install deepmicro 
# pip install -U Galaxy-ML (not working atm)
# mamba install nb_conda
`
